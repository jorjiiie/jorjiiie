  I'm a high school student who's interested in a lot of things.

  I'm interested by algorithms and computational mathematics, and although math is not my strongest suit, it's very fun to make observations and make problems solvable with code. 
  
  Currently I'm doing a lot of competitive programming on many different websites like Codeforces and Atcoder (I'm not very good), and I have dabbled in Project Euler but my math skills are currently   not quite good enough to do a respectable amount.
  
  Projects I'm (not really) working on:
        - Chess engine 
        - Algorithmic trading through random analysis (this is not as complicated as it sounds)

  I use C++ because it's popular for competitive stuff (strong standard libraries, not verbose - looking at you java, and very fast in general), but I have experience in Java and   Python.
